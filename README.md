## JEFS GraceShopper Project: PuppyBasket

Puppy Basket was a 9-day project in which we built a fully functional fullStack E-Commerce website, with Express, Sequelize, React and Redux, along with Webpack, Babel, Axios and Postgres. We built tests for our entire back-end processes in Mocha and Chai. Auth was done with PassportJS for local login, Google, Facebook and Twitter, and all our API routes are projected by functions checking for login/admin status. We used an external HTML/CSS template that we added on top of our react-redux components. Our final add-ons were done with Stripe for payment processing and NodeMailer for email notification on shipments.
